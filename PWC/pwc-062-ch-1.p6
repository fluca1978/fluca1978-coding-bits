# Write a script that takes a list of email addresses (one per line)
# and sorts them first by the domain part of the email address,
# and then by the part to the left of the @ (known as the mailbox).
# 
# Note that the domain is case-insensitive, while the mailbox part is case sensitive.
# (Some email providers choose to ignore case, but thatâ€™s another matter entirely.)
# 
# If your script is invoked with arguments, it should treat them as file names
# and read them in order, otherwise your script should read email addresses from standard input.
#
# Bonus
# 
# Add a -u option which only includes unique email addresses in the output, just like sort -u.
