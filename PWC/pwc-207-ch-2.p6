# The H-Index is the largest number h such that h articles have at least h citations each.
# For example, if an author has five publications, with 9, 7, 6, 2, and 1 citations
# (ordered from greatest to least),
# then the authorâ€™s h-index is 3, because the author has three publications
# with 3 or more citations.
# However, the author does not have four publications with 4 or more citations.
