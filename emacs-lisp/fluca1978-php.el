;; fluca-php.el
;;
;; This file provides some simple functions to enhance the Emacs library
;; in order to allow and automate some PHP related tasks, such as creating
;; new classes, new properties into classes, and so on.
;; This extension does not require the php-mode to be loaded, even if
;; it is suggested that you load the mode in your configuration.
;;
;;
;;
;; Commands defined in this file:
;; - php-class defines a new class in a new buffer saving it in the current
;;             working directory
;; - php-class-in-path defines a new PHP class skeleton in a saved buffer
;;                     asking the user for the path where to save the buffer
;; - php-prop  defines a new property with getter and setter methods
;;
;;
