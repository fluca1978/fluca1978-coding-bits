# Task 2: Descriptive Numbers
# Write a script to generate Self-descriptive Numbers in a given base.

# In mathematics, a self-descriptive number
# is an integer m that in a given base b is b digits long
# in which each digit d at position n (the most significant digit being at position 0 and the least significant at position b - 1) counts how many instances of digit n are in m.

# For example, if the given base is 10, then script should print 6210001000.
#
# Invocation example:

# % perl6 weekly-challenge/pwc_43_2.p6 --base=10
# Starting generation for base 10
# Batch between 6210001000 and 6219991000
# Batch between 7210001000 and 7219991000
# Batch between 8210001000 and 8219991000
# Batch between 9210001000 and 9219991000

# What did we generate?

# [6210001000]

# Bye bye!
