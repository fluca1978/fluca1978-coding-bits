# Perl Weekly Challenge 44
# Task 2
# You have only $1 left at the start of the week.
# You have been given an opportunity to make it $200. The rule is simple with every move you can either double what
# you have or add another $1. Write a script to help you get $200 with the smallest number of moves.
# See <https://perlweeklychallenge.org/blog/perl-weekly-challenge-044/>
#
# Start with one buck,
#   then double to get 2 $,
#   then add one buck to get 3 $,
#   then double to get 6 $,
#   then double to get 12 $,
#   then double to get 24 $,
#   then add one buck to get 25 $,
#   then double to get 50 $,
#   then double to get 100 $,
#   then double to get 200 $
# You need 9 operations to get from 1 $ to 200 $!
