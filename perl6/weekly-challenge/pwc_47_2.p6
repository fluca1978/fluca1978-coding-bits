# Task 2
# Gapful Number
#
# Write a script to print first 20 Gapful Numbers greater than or equal to 100.
# Please check out the page for more information about Gapful Numbers.
# From <https://oeis.org/A108343>
# Gapful numbers >= 100: numbers that are divisible by the number
# formed by their first and last digit.
# Numbers up to 100 trivially have this property and are excluded.
