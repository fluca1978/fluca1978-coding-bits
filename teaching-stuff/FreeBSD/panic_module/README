This module is a didactic one that modifies the mkdir and open syscalls injecting
a panicable version. The new installed version, when invoked with a particular path
(and mode) will generate a panic.

- panicModule.h
Declares the module initialization structure, that is used to handle
the data that the module will use to check if the syscall have to generate
a panic.

- panicModule.c
module handler implementation. The main module handler installs and removes the
panicable syscalls so that when the user decides to crash the system
can exploit the modified syscalls.

- panicModuleSyscalls.h
Declaration of the syscalls and their arguments that will be used by this module.

- panicModuleSyscalls.c
Definition of the panicable system calls. Each system call, when called, could produce
a panic on the system if the path (and mode) match those of a module initialization
list.
